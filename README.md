1. Description
--------------

Kokgee (Pronounced KOH-ghee) is a Tetris clone designed to be flexible and amenable to research.  It is designed to be compliant with the original Tetris specifications, but adds some enhancements such as CW rotation, "speeded drop" and next piece preview.  Scoring is simplified and only accounts for completed lines.
